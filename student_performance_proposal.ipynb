    "A student's grades is often the associative indicator of the student's performance in school. While a student's innate intelligence is often the predictor variable in the student's grades, there are likely other factors that affect the grades. In our study, we investigate whether certain environmental factors are significant in influencing a student's performance. We selected Math grades as the indicator for performance, as it is a subject that can be objectively evaluated. Our data set consists of 395 secondary students from two Portuguese schools, with their grades in mathematics and environmental factors collected through questionnaires.\n"
